# **Exploring the Requirements of Data Protection Regulations and Developing a Compliance Plan**

With increasing digitization, organizations collect and process large amounts of personal data. To protect individuals’ privacy rights, governments have introduced data protection regulations such as GDPR (EU) and DPDPA 2023 (India). These laws define how data should be collected, stored, processed, shared, and protected.
This report explores key requirements of data protection regulations and presents a detailed plan for compliance.
